For contributing to this repo please follow these steps:


- Fork, clone, blah blah (You can read it anywhere)
- Open the `numpy-guide.ipynb` file in your jupyter notebook to edit it.(In order to make a PR).
- Add two or more functions (at least add two functions) with two unique examples and a third example explaining where not to use that particular function (and also how to fix it).
- Before adding those functions, please make sure that they dont exist already by refering to the README.md file or else your PR wont be approved.
- And also add your functions in the README.md file.

Also if somehow you dont have jupyter notebook installed(or foor that sake any software to run .ipynb files), then here's the link to my online public notebook hosted on kaggle:


[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/invincibleprince/a-guide-to-numpy)


You can the edit the notebook from there and download it locally and replace it with current version(or better surf the internet)
